# Tennis Pitcher Control App

This project features a custom-built tennis pitcher designed and constructed by our team. The accompanying codebase includes a React Native app that allows users to control the tennis pitcher via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), communicating with a programmed ESP32 microprocessor. The system operates with 5 motors to control the feed, height, backspin, topspin, and direction of the tennis pitcher. Users can save configurations locally or execute them directly from their device for seamless and personalized training sessions.
